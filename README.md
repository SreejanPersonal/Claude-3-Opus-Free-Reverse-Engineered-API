### ü™õ Intallation

To get started with the Claude 3 Opus Free Reverse Engineered API, follow these steps to unlock the full potential of this innovative project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SreejanPersonal/Claude-3-Opus-Free-Reverse-Engineered-API.git
   ```
   This will download the entire project to your local machine, giving you access to the source code and necessary files.

2. **Install Required Modules**: Next, navigate to the project directory and install the required Python modules listed in `requirements.txt`. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Run API Key Generation Script**: Execute the `Theb_AI_Login.py` script to initiate the API key generation process. This script will automatically login to `https://beta.theb.ai/` using temporary emails and generate API keys for you.

4. **Configure Parallel API Key Generation**: To optimize the API key generation process, configure the `at_once` value according to your system specifications (Defaults to 5 i.e. On running once it will generate five api keys). This will allow you to generate API keys in parallel, significantly reducing the time required to obtain the desired number of keys.

5. **Understand API Key Limitations**: It's essential to note that each API key provides $0.05 credit, but this limit only applies to specific responses. For instance, if you ask a query with a 100K context window, there is no issue, and there is no bound on the output token generated by the AI model. However, you won't be able to send a second request since you have exhausted all your top-up amount in the first response. This is a known glitch in the website.

6. **Run AI Interaction Script**: Once you have generated the API keys, run either `ThebAI.ipynb` (recommended for faster execution) or `ThebAI.py` to interact with the AI model. These scripts will allow you to leverage the capabilities of Claude 3 Opus and explore its features.

7. **Explore Additional Models**: Don't limit yourself to Claude 3 Opus! You can also explore other models available in the project, each with its unique features and capabilities.

8. **Optional: Implement Concurrent Execution**: To take your project to the next level, consider implementing multitasking or threading to run API key generation and AI responses concurrently. This will significantly improve the overall performance and efficiency of your project.

By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to harnessing the power of the Claude 3 Opus Free Reverse Engineered API and unlocking its full potential.
